Guess The Number Game
Description
"Guess The Number" is a simple JavaScript game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Each level offers a different range of numbers and a set number of attempts to guess the correct number.
How It Works
1. Choose a Difficulty Level: The player selects a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard).
2. Number Generation: Based on the chosen difficulty, a random number is generated within a specific range:
Easy: Guess a number between 1 and 10. You have 5 attempts.
Medium: Guess a number between 1 and 100. You have 10 attempts.
Hard: Guess a number between 1 and 1000. You have 15 attempts.
3. Guessing: The player is prompted to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. Winning: If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, a congratulatory message is displayed.
5. Losing: If the player fails to guess the number within the allowed attempts, the correct number is revealed.
